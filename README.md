Stock prediction project using LSTM

This project aims to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM networks are well-suited for time series forecasting tasks, as they can learn long-term dependencies in the data.

To train the LSTM model, we will use historical stock data. The model will learn to predict the next day's closing price based on the previous days' closing prices.

Once the model is trained, we can use it to predict future stock prices. This information can be used by investors to make informed trading decisions.Stock prediction project using LSTM
